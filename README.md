## 🚀 Hi! My name is Pavel Gladkih. Specialist in mathematical modeling and data scientist.


I am engaged in modeling the evolution of internal structures in metals and alloys during metal forming using crystal plasticity. 

In addition, I apply machine learning and deep learning methods to automate and analyze the obtained data.
